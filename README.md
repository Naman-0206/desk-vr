**Description:**

DeskVR is an innovative utility hosted on [deskvr.onrender.com](https://deskvr.onrender.com), revolutionizing your desktop experience by extending it into virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) environments. With DeskVR, users can connect to their desktop computers and initialize a virtual secondary screen, seamlessly integrating with their smartphones for lighter web utilities. This project aims to bring immersive AR experiences at a much cheaper price than modern VR and MR solutions, making advanced technology more accessible to all.
